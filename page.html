	<h2 id="What">Copyright</h2>
	<p>On table page of my website, I uploaded a YouTube video of fight scenes from the movie "Godzilla: King of the Monsters" to give a little perspective of the different Kaijus. Warner Bros., Legendary Entertainment, Toho Company, Wanda Qingdao Studios, and WarnerMediaÂ© all own copyrights to the movie the YouTube clip is from. YouTube videos are copyrighted to the person who created and uploaded them onto YouTube; in this case, the creators were the production companies I mentioned. The person who uploaded the video shared the link but did not claim it as their own and mentioned the production companies in the video caption.The same with my list page. I uploaded the Godzilla theme song, which Akira Ifukube holds the copyright. The original uploader did not claim the rights to the music.</p>
	<h3 id="Where">Color and Font</h3>
	<p>Initially, I tried to match the colors of the pages to its content. For example, King Ghidorah and Rodan have colors matching their bodies. Color contrast is significant because text and background colors can determine how people interact with the content written in those colors. Low-contrast colors are challenging to read when text contrasts poorly with background colors, while high-contrast colors are easier to read when paired. I went through a few font choices, and at first had Lucida Handwriting for a while. However, the more I looked at my pages, the more that font seemed hard to read. I ended with a simplier font like Calibri.</p>
