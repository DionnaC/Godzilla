<p>The "Fire Demon," or Rodan, was a massive winged Titan that had a thing for molten rock and active volcanoes. Ancient people feared him because he could destroy whole towns by flying above them. Rodan settled inside the magma-filled volcano crater on the island that would become Isla de Mara in Mexico. By 1973, thanks to research into ancient cave drawings showing Rodan and other Titans like Godzilla, Mothra, and King Ghidorah, the scientific organization Monarch — created in the wake of World War II to study and hunt for Titans — had learned of Rodan's existence. In 1991, Monarch discovered Rodan dormant in pyrostasis inside the Isla de Mara volcano and established Outpost 56 to investigate and imprison him.</p>

<p>The Japanese name for Rodan is Radon, short for "Pteranodon." It might have been picked to allude to radioactivity as well. It's possible that the similarity between the katakana forms of Radon and Ladon, a dragon-like creature from Greek mythology, is only a coincidence. In English-speaking regions, the name was changed to "Rodan" to prevent consumer confusion with the element radon. After some time, Toho trademarked the word "Rodan," making it the official English name for the monster. But in the English versions of Terror of Mechagodzilla and Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II, the name "Radon" was adopted. This was also the case with Invasion of Astro-Monster.</p>

<p>Due to his internal volcanic combustion engine, Rodan emits heat that may exceed 1200 degrees Celsius. Therefore, Rodan's skin is dangerously hot to the touch, and he uses this to his advantage during his fight with Mothra, slowly burning her to the brink of death. After Mothra stabbed Rodan, the wound spat a little bit of fire.</p>

<p>Rodan's primary weapons are his speed and agility; he can leave a path of destruction in his wake by flying at supersonic speeds at low altitudes, creating hurricane-force winds and catastrophic sonic booms. As shown in Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II, his beak and talons are also helpful in combat, and despite their fragile look, his wings are surprisingly robust.</p>

<p>The roar of Rodan combines the sounds of birds and airplanes. Rodan's roar begins with a screaming sound, unlike a bird's. After then, the noise becomes considerably lower and more shrill. His shout fades into a drawn-out sigh. Many kaiju, including Heisei King Ghidorah and Battra, used Rodan's roar.</p>
