<p>King Ghidorah, also known as Monster Zero, Titanus Ghidorah, and Ghidorah, is a three-headed dragon dai kaiju from outer space. In the concluding moments of Kong: Skull Island in 2017, a reference was made to Ghidorah, the primary antagonist of Godzilla: King of the Monsters, released in 2019, and one of the overarching villains of Godzilla vs. Kong, which was released in 2016. Monarch found Ghidorah, Godzilla's apex predator adversary, hibernating under an Antarctic glacier.</p>

<p>The monster known as King Dragon in Japan gets his Japanese moniker, Ghidorah, from the Soviet film Zmey Gorynych in 1956. The name "Ghidorah" comes from the Russian pronunciation of "Hydra." The protagonists refer to this version of Ghidorah primarily as Monster Zero until they learn of traditions revealing its extraterrestrial origin and refer to it as "Ghidorah, the One Who Is Many." From that point on, the extraterrestrial monster is mainly referred to as "Ghidorah" by the characters of Godzilla: King of the Monsters. During creation, the three heads of Ghidorah were given the Japanese numbers one, two, and three in the form of Ichi (the center head), Ni (the right head), and San (the left head). The moniker "Kevin" is also given to San, maybe because of his short attention span. The Godzilla fandom now uses this as a running joke and a source of memes.</p>

<p>The bio-electrical golden gravity beams that erupt from King Ghidorah's jaws are his hallmark assault. These are destructive enough to rip through walls and shatter lives. When he's in full charge mode, the fronts of his necks light up yellow. It is also proven that this strike may physically injure other Titans. Ghidorah took down Rodan with a single shot while a focused onslaught obliterated Mothra. Even though this strike delivered no permanent damage to the Titan, it was powerful enough to knock Godzilla off the ice during their first encounter in Antarctica. His gravity rays recharge far more quickly than Godzilla's atomic breath.</p>

<p>In addition to his electrical beams, he also has regenerative powers, wings that can create hurricanes, and a pair of tails, one of which is spiky and may be used as a club.</p>

<p>The new scream of King Ghidorah in the MonsterVerse was designed to sound like the many cackling noises he made in the Showa series. These roars feature recorded hisses and rattles from snakes. In the Showa series, his trill can be heard immediately before he arrives in Fenway Park, and in the Heisei series, his scream can be heard when he fights Godzilla there. He also makes Vastatosaurus rex roars from King Kong: The Official Game of the Movie, although with some subtle modifications, throughout the film.</p>
