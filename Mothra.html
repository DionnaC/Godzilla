<p>Mothra is a mythical monster, also known as a kaiju, that originally appears in the 1961 film Mothra, which was produced and marketed by Toho Studios. Mothra has featured in a number of Toho tokusatsu films, most notably as a recurrent character in the Godzilla series. She is usually shown as a massive intelligent larva (caterpillar) or imago, accompanied by two little fairies who speak for her. Mothra, unlike other Toho monsters, is mostly heroic, having been depicted as a defender of her own island civilization, the Earth, and Japan. Mothra's design is inspired by silk worms, their imagos, and huge silk moths of the Saturniidae family. While nearing death, the figure is often represented hatching children (in some instances, twins), an homage to the Sasra theory of many Indian faiths.</p>

<p>Mothra is one of Toho's most popular monsters, coming in second only to Godzilla in terms of overall cinematic appearances. Surveys performed in the early 1990s revealed that Mothra was especially popular with women, who were the biggest demographic among Japan's moviegoers at the time, prompting the production of 1992's Godzilla vs. Mothra, which was the best-attended Toho picture since King Kong vs. Godzilla. Mothra was ranked third on IGN's "Top 10 Japanese Movie Monsters" list, and seventh on Complex's "The 15 Most Badass Kaiju Monsters of All Time" list."</p>

<p>Mothra's trademark weapon is her "god rays" which are focused beams of beta-wave bioluminescence that she can discharge via her wing patterns. She originally uses it as a beacon to connect with Godzilla and guide Monarch to him, but she can also weaponize it to produce intense, near-blinding blue light or angelic-looking golden-white light. These god-rays may also fully clear storm clouds and generate tremendous winds.</p>

<p>Mothra can fight other kaiju using her raptorial forelimbs and stinger, such as Rodan. While resembling a moth, her battle technique is quite similar to that of insects such as praying mantises and wasps, who fight with their raptorial legs and stinger.</p>

<p>Mothra and Godzilla have a symbiotic connection, which presents itself in a variety of ways. The design on her wings, for example, is supposed to resemble Godzilla's eyes. Mothra uses sonar to communicate with Godzilla across large distances.</p>
